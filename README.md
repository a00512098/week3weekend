# Week 3 Weekend

This app lets the user handle a list of employees. The user can see the employees, update their data, create new employees and delete them.

This is how the app looks like:

List of users | Find user | Edit user | Delete user warning | Create new user |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
